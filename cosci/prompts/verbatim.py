Review Overview:
{reviews_overview}

Procedure:
Initial contribution (if initiating the discussion):
Propose three distinct {idea_attributes} hypotheses.

Subsequent contributions (continuing the discussion):
* Pose clarifying questions if ambiguities or uncertainties arise.
* Critically evaluate the hypotheses proposed thus far, addressing the following aspects:
    - Adherence to {idea_attributes} criteria.
    - Utility and practicality.
    - Level of detail and specificity.
* Identify any weaknesses or potential limitations.
* Propose concrete improvements and refinements to address identified weaknesses.
* Conclude your response with a refined iteration of the hypothesis.

General guidelines:
* Exhibit boldness and creativity in your contributions.
* Maintain a helpful and collaborative approach.
* Prioritize the generation of a high-quality {idea_attributes} hypothesis.

Termination condition:
When sufficient discussion has transpired (typically 3-5 conversational turns, with a maximum of 10 turns) and all relevant questions and points have been thoroughly addressed and clarified, conclude the process by writing "HYPOTHESIS" (in all capital letters) followed by a concise and self-contained exposition of the finalized idea.

REFLECT_OBSERVATION = """You are an expert in scientific hypothesis evaluation. Your task is to analyze the relationship between a provided hypothesis and observations from a scientific article. Specifically, determine if the hypothesis provides a novel causal explanation for the observations, or if they contradict it.

Instructions:
1. Observation extraction: list relevant observations from the article.
2. Causal analysis (individual): for each observation:
   a. State if its cause is already established.
   b. Assess if the hypothesis could be a causal factor (hypothesis => observation). Start with: "would we see this observation if the hypothesis was true:".
   c. Explain if it's a novel explanation. If not, or if a better explanation exists, state: "not a missing piece."
3. Causal analysis (summary): determine if the hypothesis offers a novel explanation for a subset of observations. Include reasoning. Start with: "would we see some of the observations if the hypothesis was true:".
4. Disproof analysis: determine if any observations contradict the hypothesis. Start with: "does some observations disprove the hypothesis:".
5. Conclusion: state: "hypothesis: <already explained, other explanations more likely, missing piece, neutral, or disproved>".

Scoring:
* Already explained: hypothesis consistent, but causes are known. No novel explanation.
* Other explanations more likely: hypothesis *could* explain, but better explanations exist.
* Missing piece: hypothesis offers a novel, plausible explanation.
* Neutral: hypothesis neither explains nor is contradicted.
* Disproved: observations contradict the hypothesis.

Important: if observations are expected regardless of the hypothesis, and don't disprove it, it's neutral.

Turn 1: begin with a concise summary of both hypotheses and their respective initial reviews.
Subsequent turns:

* Critically evaluate each hypothesis in relation to the stated Goal and Criteria. This evaluation should consider aspects such as:

    - Novelty and originality.
